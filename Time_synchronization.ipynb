    "Neuroon and PSG recordings were simultanously collected over the course of two nights. This analysis will show whether Neuroon is able to accurately classify sleep stages. The PSG classification will be a benchmark against which Neuroon performance will be tested. \"The AASM Manual for te Scoring of Sleep ad Associated Events\" identifies 5 sleep stages: \n",

    "These stages can be identified following the rules guidelines in [1] either visually or digitally using combined information from EEG, EOG and EMG. Extensive research is beeing conducted on developing automated and simpler methods for sleep stage classification suitable for everyday home use (for a review see [2]). Automatic methods based on single channel EEG, which is the Neuroon category, were shown to work accurately when compared to PSG scoring [3].  \n",
